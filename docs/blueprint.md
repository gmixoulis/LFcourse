# **App Name**: JSON Quizzinator

## Core Features:

- JSON Loader: Loads and parses JSON files from a specified directory within the Next.js application.
- Question Display: Displays questions, options, and explanations from the parsed JSON data, formatted for readability.
- Navigation Controls: Enables users to navigate through questions using 'Next' and 'Back' buttons.
- Answer Highlighting: Highlights the correct answer after the user submits their choice.
- AI Hint Generation: Uses a generative AI tool to provide hints for questions if requested. The AI determines the relevance and helpfulness of each hint based on the current question.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #735FBF (RGB). A saturated violet provides a intellectual but lively, forward-thinking feel.
- Background color: #F0EDF9 (RGB). A very light desaturated tint of violet will create a calming, studious background.
- Accent color: #BF5F6D (RGB). This contrasting, brighter red-violet will add emphasis and guide the eye.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif font, lends an elegant, intellectual feel.
- Minimalist icons for navigation and interaction (e.g., arrow icons for 'Next' and 'Back', a lightbulb icon for the AI hint feature).
- Clean, centered layout for questions and options to minimize distraction.
- Subtle fade-in animations for question transitions.
